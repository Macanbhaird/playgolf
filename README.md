#Web Apps in R: Building Data-Driven Web Application in R | Shiny Tutorial Ep 3
#In this R Shiny tutorial video, I will guide you through the process of building a simple data-driven web application in R using the Shiny web framework. This ML-based web app that we are building will be data-driven in the sense that it makes use of the random forest algorithm for predicting whether to play or not play golf as a function of the input weather parameters (weather outlook, temperature, humidity and windy).
